# Palace Kino Cinema System

Project Oveview: In my 4th semester of Diploma, my team and I developed the Palace Kino Cinema System, a desktop application for a cinema booking and management system. The goal was to streamline ticket bookings, showtime management, 
and customer data tracking for efficient cinema operations. Using VB.NET for logic, SQL Server for database management, and Windows Forms for an intuitive interface, the project was designed to improve customer experience, 
support ticket pricing variations, and provide staff with a reliable system for handling bookings and customer records.

Technologies Used: VB.NET, WinForms, Microsoft SQL Server, Visual Studio, ADO.NET (System.Data.SqlClient)

Key Features and Achievements

Movie and Showtime Management: Developed a system to manage movie listings, showing dates and times, allowing for a streamlined booking experience for users and accurate showtime scheduling.

Customer Information and Ticket Booking: Implemented features to track customer data and enable ticket bookings, facilitating efficient customer service and record-keeping.

Ticket Pricing Based on Categories: Integrated pricing variations by ticket type (e.g., Adult, Senior, Child), ensuring accurate pricing calculations.

Database Integration with SQL Server: Used SQL Server for secure data storage, leveraging ADO.NET for robust data handling and transaction processing.

User-Friendly Interface: Designed an accessible interface using Windows Forms, enhancing user engagement and ease of use in the booking process.


This project deepened my expertise in desktop application development, particularly using VB.NET and SQL Server for database management. Working with ADO.NET enhanced my skills in secure data handling 
and transaction management, while designing with Windows Forms strengthened my user interface capabilities. The project gave me practical experience in building efficient booking systems and managing customer 
and ticket data, effectively preparing me for future roles that require database integration, user-focused design, and efficient data management for streamlined business operations.
